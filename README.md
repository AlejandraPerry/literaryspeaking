## Inspiration

Growing up in Miami, where most of the population are first generation US citizens and immigrants, we've seen firsthand how language contributes to disparities in opportunities. From not being to pass essential exams for citizenship, restrictions in advanced course options at school, and not being able to sustain a job, not knowing English in the US affects individuals of all walks of life. Therefore, we developed a nonprofit program and online platform that aids individuals across Miami and anyone interested in learning English. 

## What it does

**Overview**

Our web app consists of seven major features: In person and online English instruction, academic tutoring, college advising, bilingual lessons, researched articles, newsletter, and admin page.

**English Instruction, Academic Tutoring, and College Advising**

Students and volunteers can navigate to our "Get Involved" section on our navigation pane to select the page that best suits their interests. In each page, they can view detailed descriptions of the services we have to offer which include three in-person locations and online options for homework help, test preparation, interviewing skills, conversations, and professional skills for students and adults learning English. Once they sign up, we receive a notification and match mentees with mentors. We utilize a similar system for matching students with college advisors, where students can receive help from a real college student, including previous English language learners and first generation students from top schools. Our sustainable system allows learners to schedule both one-time and weekly sessions with their mentor.

**Lessons and Articles**

Users of our website can navigate between our bilingual articles and lessons, all of which are produced by our team of volunteers. Our articles address community and world issues such as education, poverty, and equity in various writing styles such as editorials, op-eds, and stories. They feature researched citations and imaged, and are peer-reviewed before publishing. Similarly with our lessons, volunteer produce self-guided and session-supplementary lessons for a large range of topics, such as learning English, science, and SAT prep. They're divided by subject, module, and unit where students and teachers can explore an array of options, including writing, pictures, videos, PDFs, and embedded quizzes. 

**Newsletter and Admin Page**

Users can subscribe to our newsletter to receive seasonal notifications on our events and updates. They can also visit our news page to learn more about previous and current events. The website can be dynamically modified using the admin page, where the site manager can set permissions for users, modify and publish content, and supervise comments and form submissions. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Since beginning in January 2024, we’ve been able to establish Literary Speaking at three schools, individually impact more than 80 students with 92% greater confidence across Miami, and build a team of more than 40 volunteers who have participated in the program for over 1000 hours throughout the school year. Through this platform, we’ve been able to donate $1500 worth of donations to local organizations with more than 200 participants.
